# tik-tak-toe
## Description
This project is a game programming using react. It requires two players 'X' and 'O' to play. The one who achieves a line by marking a set of squares distributed in rows and columns wins.

## How to Run
Put the URL of this project on your browser and the game will appear on the screen.

## Roadmap of future improvements
One future I am planning to make is adding a count-down timer so each player has a limited time to play their turn. 

## License information
This project has an MIT license.
